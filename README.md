+ question 
    + how does 3D -> 2D rendering works? depth peeling
    + displaced centroid?

+ idea
    + skeleton based deformation for support for 3D printing
+ bounded biharmonic weights for real-time deformation
    + given skeleton, gneerate weights for each vertex
+ fast automatic skinning transofmration 
    + ARAP skeleton


+ todo
    + 2D prototype, 
        + use http://libigl.github.io/libigl/python-bindings/
        + generalize overhang energy term to skeleton...
